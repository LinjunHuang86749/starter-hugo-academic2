Comprehensively studied the [A Cheap Bootstrap Method for Fast Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00090) and [a biased stochastic estimators](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04673). Designed and Extensively studied the numerical performance of estimators based on the simulations.

L. Huang, Global Solution to a Non-linear Wave Equation of Liquid Crystal in the Constant
Electric Field, SIAM Undergraduate Research Online Vol 12, 125-153. [(DOI: 10.1137/18S017557)](https://www.siam.org/Portals/0/Publications/SIURO/Vol12/S01755.pdf?ver=2019-05-08-151446-337).
Used the variational principle to derive the partial differential equation (PDE).
Introduced the notation of the energy conserved weak solution for the PDE and proved
the existence of the energy conserved weak solution by the method of characteristics.
