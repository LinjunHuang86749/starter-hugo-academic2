## Graduate Research and Research Assistant

Columbia University Feb 2020 --- June 2021

Principal Investigator: [Henry Lam](http://www.columbia.edu/~khl2114/)

Comprehensively studied [a Cheap Bootstrap Method for Fast
Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00090) and [a biased stochastic
estimators](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04673). Designed and Extensively
studied the numerical performance of estimators based on the
simulations.

L. Huang, Global Solution to a Non-linear Wave Equation of Liquid
Crystal in the Constant Electric Field, SIAM Undergraduate Research
Online Vol 12, 125-153. [(DOI:
10.1137/18S017557)](https://www.siam.org/Portals/0/Publications/SIURO/Vol12/S01755.pdf?ver=2019-05-08-151446-337).

-   Used the variational principle to derive the partial differential
    equation (PDE).

-   Introduced the notation of the energy conserved weak solution for
    the PDE and proved the existence of the energy conserved weak
    solution by the method of characteristics.
