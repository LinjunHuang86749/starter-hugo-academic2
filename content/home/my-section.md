L. Huang, Global Solution to a Non-linear Wave Equation of Liquid Crystal in the Constant
Electric Field, SIURO Vol 12, 125-153. [(DOI: 10.1137/18S017557)](https://www.siam.org/Portals/0/Publications/SIURO/Vol12/S01755.pdf?ver=2019-05-08-151446-337).
o Used the variational principle to derive the partial differential equation (PDE).
o Introduced the notation of the energy conserved weak solution for the PDE and proved
the existence of the energy conserved weak solution by the method of characteristics.
